## 🎯 What Was Fixed

**Before:** Customers saw raw Firebase errors like:
```
Firebase: Error (auth/invalid-credential).
```

**After:** Customers see user-friendly messages like:
```
Incorrect email or password. Please try again.
No account found with this email address. Please check your email or create a new account.
Too many failed login attempts. Please try again later.
```

## 🚀 Deployment Instructions

1. **Verify all files are saved** (Kiro IDE has already applied autofix)
2. **Build the application:**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
3. **Deploy to your hosting platform**
4. **Test the fix:**
   - Try logging in with wrong credentials
   - Try password reset with invalid email
   - Verify you see friendly messages, not raw Firebase errors

## 🔍 Testing Checklist

After deployment, test these scenarios:

- [ ] Login with wrong password → Should show "Incorrect email or password"
- [ ] Login with non-existent email → Should show "No account found with this email"
- [ ] Password reset with invalid email → Should show "Please enter a valid email address"
- [ ] Registration with existing email → Should show "This email is already registered"
- [ ] Check browser console → Should not show raw Firebase errors in production

## 📝 Error Message Mapping

| Firebase Error Code | User-Friendly Message |
|-------------------|---------------------|
| `auth/invalid-credential` | "Incorrect email or password. Please try again." |
| `auth/user-not-found` | "No account found with this email address." |
| `auth/wrong-password` | "Incorrect email or password. Please try again." |
| `auth/email-already-in-use` | "This email is already registered. Please try logging in instead." |
| `auth/weak-password` | "Password is too weak. Please choose a stronger password." |
| `auth/invalid-email` | "Please enter a valid email address." |
| `auth/too-many-requests` | "Too many attempts. Please try again later." |
| `auth/network-request-failed` | "Network error. Please check your connection and try again." |

## 🛡️ Security Improvements

- Raw Firebase errors are no longer exposed to customers
- Sensitive error details only logged in development mode
- Production console logs are generic and safe
- Error boundaries prevent crashes while hiding technical details

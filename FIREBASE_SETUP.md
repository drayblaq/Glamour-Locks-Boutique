## üìã Setup Instructions

### 1. Environment Variables
Make sure these are set in your `.env.local`:

```bash
# Firebase (already configured)
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=AIzaSyA6FJR-AWNgjnsW2_oNCzsmku_L-SPJfjg
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=glamourlocks-boutique.firebaseapp.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=glamourlocks-boutique
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=glamourlocks-boutique.firebasestorage.app
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=421069906534
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=1:421069906534:web:368a0b7f7131e3c7fbc3a7
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID=G-6V06JT1EJT

# Other required variables
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=your_stripe_secret_key
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=your_stripe_webhook_secret
ADMIN_EMAIL=your_admin_email@example.com
```

### 2. Firebase Console Setup

1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Select your project: `glamourlocks-boutique`
3. Enable Firestore Database:
   - Go to Firestore Database
   - Click "Create Database"
   - Choose "Start in test mode" (for development)
   - Select a location (choose closest to your users)

4. Set up Security Rules:
   ```javascript
   rules_version = '2';
   service cloud.firestore {
     match /databases/{database}/documents {
       // Allow read access to products for all users
       match /products/{productId} {
         allow read: if true;
         allow write: if request.auth != null;
       }
       
       // Allow read/write access to orders for authenticated users
       match /orders/{orderId} {
         allow read, write: if request.auth != null;
       }
     }
   }
   ```

### 3. Data Migration

Run the migration script to move existing products to Firestore:

```bash
node src/scripts/migrate-to-firestore.js
```

This will:
- Read products from `src/data/products.ts`
- Convert them to Firestore format
- Add them to your Firestore database
- Show migration progress and results

### 4. Testing the Integration

1. **Start your development server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Test the admin dashboard**:
   - Go to `/admin/dashboard/products`
   - Try adding, editing, and deleting products
   - Check that changes persist in Firestore

3. **Test the main products page**:
   - Go to `/products`
   - Verify products load from Firestore
   - Test search and filtering

4. **Test order creation**:
   - Make a test purchase
   - Check that orders are saved to Firestore
   - Verify email notifications work

### Common Issues

1. **"Firebase not initialized" error**
   - Check that Firebase config is correct
   - Verify environment variables are set

2. **"Permission denied" errors**
   - Check Firestore security rules
   - Ensure authentication is working

3. **Products not loading**
   - Check browser console for errors
   - Verify Firestore connection
   - Check if data was migrated successfully

4. **Migration script fails**
   - Ensure Node.js is installed
   - Check Firebase credentials
   - Verify products.ts file exists

### Debug Commands

```bash
# Check Firebase connection
node -e "const { initializeApp } = require('firebase/app'); const app = initializeApp({...}); console.log('Firebase initialized successfully')"

# Test Firestore access
node src/scripts/test-firestore.js

# View current products
node src/scripts/list-products.js
```

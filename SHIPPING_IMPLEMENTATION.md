# Enhanced Shipping Implementation

## Overview
I've successfully implemented a comprehensive shipping system for your ecommerce site with the following features:

## ‚úÖ What's Been Implemented

### 1. **Shipping Options API** (`/api/shipping-options`)
- **GET**: Fetch all active shipping options
- **POST**: Create new shipping options (admin)
- **PUT**: Update existing shipping options (admin)
- **DELETE**: Remove shipping options (admin)

**Default Shipping Options:**
- Standard Shipping: ¬£4.99 (3-5 working days)
- Express Shipping: ¬£9.99 (1-2 working days)
- Next Day Delivery: ¬£15.99 (Next working day)

### 2. **Dynamic Shipping Calculation** (`/api/calculate-shipping`)
- Location-based pricing multipliers
- Weight-based surcharges
- Free shipping thresholds
- Estimated delivery dates

**Pricing Rules:**
- **Free Shipping**: Standard shipping free on orders over ¬£50
- **Express Discount**: 50% off express shipping on orders over ¬£75
- **Location Multipliers**:
  - UK: 1.0x - 1.2x base rate
  - US: 1.5x - 1.8x base rate
  - Other countries: 2.0x base rate
- **Weight Surcharge**: ¬£2.50 per 2kg over 5kg total weight

### 3. **Enhanced Checkout Flow**
Updated the cart page with a new 5-step process:
1. **Cart** - Review items
2. **Info** - Customer details + country selection
3. **Shipping** - Choose delivery method with real-time pricing
4. **Review** - Confirm order details including shipping
5. **Payment** - Complete purchase with total including shipping

### 4. **Shipping Options Component**
- Real-time shipping cost calculation
- Visual shipping method selection
- Estimated delivery dates
- Free shipping notifications
- Location-aware pricing

### 5. **Admin Shipping Management**
- Full CRUD operations for shipping options
- Visual shipping rules overview
- Active/inactive status management
- Sort order configuration

### 6. **Updated Order Structure**
Enhanced order data to include:
```typescript
{
  shipping: number;
  shippingDetails: {
    optionId: string;
    optionName: string;
    estimatedDelivery: string;
    trackingNumber?: string;
  };
}
```

## üöÄ Key Features

   - Item weights
3. **Customer selects preferred shipping method** with clear pricing and delivery estimates
